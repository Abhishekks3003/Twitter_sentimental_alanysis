# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, and in this case, tweets from Twitter. The goal is to analyze and categorize each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment it conveys.

## Contents

- `data/`: This folder contains sample Twitter data in CSV format. The dataset includes tweets along with their corresponding metadata, such as timestamp and user information.

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the step-by-step process of sentiment analysis using different algorithms and techniques. The notebooks cover data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

- `src/`: This folder includes Python scripts that are used in the Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model building. It also contains utility functions for data cleaning and text processing.

- `requirements.txt`: A text file that lists all the required Python libraries and their versions needed to run the code.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter notebooks, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- tweepy (for accessing Twitter API)
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- wordcloud (for generating word clouds)

You can install all the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Create a Twitter developer account and obtain API keys and access tokens. Replace the placeholders in the `config.py` file with your own credentials.

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform sentiment analysis using various techniques.

4. Experiment with different algorithms, feature extraction methods, and preprocessing techniques to improve the sentiment analysis results.
